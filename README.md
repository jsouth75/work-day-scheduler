# Work day scheduler

## Task

Create a schedule for a typical work day that stores events that are entered in the input area on the local storage.
    1.  This allows a user to add events to a work schedule form 8 to 5 
    2.  The current date appears at the top
    3.  Time blocks have a list of hours, text area, and a save button
    4.  The time blocks will be color coded depending on whether that slot is in the past,   present, or future.
    5.  User can enter an event in text area then click save, which will then be saved in the local storage.
